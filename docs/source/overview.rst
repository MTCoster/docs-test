Overview
========

Welcome to the documentation for TEDxWarwick's new website.  You should start by reading `Making Changes`_ which gives detailed instructions for creating, previewing and submitting your edits to the website.  After that, the rest of the documentation is broken up into three sections:

:Content:   contains information for anyone who wishes to make changes to text or images on the website.  This is for everyone.
:Design:    details the structure of the underlying website.  Anyone wishing to make changes beyond those detailed in Content should read this.
:Docs:      is an overview of how this documentation was generated.  You should read this if you are planning to make any changes to the website which will result in the documentation becoming innacurate.
