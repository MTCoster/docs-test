Overview
########

Welcome to the documentation for TEDxWarwick's new website. If you've never
been here before (or if it's just been a while), you should start by reading
:doc:`changes` which gives detailed instructions for creating, previewing and
submitting your edits to the website. After that, the rest of the documentation
is broken up into three sections:

:doc:`content`
--------------
Contains information for anyone who wishes to make changes to text or images on
the website. This is for everyone.

:doc:`design`
-------------
Details the structure of the underlying website. Anyone wishing to make changes
beyond those detailed in Content should read this.

:doc:`docs`
-----------
An overview of how this documentation was generated. You should read this if
you are planning to make any changes to the website which will result in the
documentation becoming innacurate.
