In order to make updating the website straightforward for as many people as
possible, there is an intentional separation of content from design. In this
section, we will be deailing primarily with two types of files:

:ref:`Markdown <markdown>` is a very simple way of adding formatting
information to a simple text file.  These documents use the ``.md`` extension,
and can be modified in any text editor.

:ref:`YAML <yaml>` is a format for storing organised data, again in a simple
text file. These use the ``.yml`` extension, and can be modified much the same
as markdown files.
